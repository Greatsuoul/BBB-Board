you have to enable a device tree overlay for one-wire For DHT11

The Device Tree language is a way to describe hardware that is present in a system and cannot be automatically detected.
do not provide mechanisms for dynamic enumeration and identification of devices.
Device Tree (DTB: Device Tree Binary), passed to the kernel by the bootloader at boot time, lets the kernel know which SoC and devices to initialize.
all you have to do is create a new Device Tree describing your new hardware, compile it, and boot the distribution’s kernel with it
don’t need to recompile that kernel

Device Tree Source (DTS) files are normally distributed by kernel developers inside the Linux sources
at boot time, all you have to do is load the main DTB for your board, and then override it using the DTBOs corresponding to the capes which are currently mounted.
bootloader based solution at boot time remains so far the best one.
